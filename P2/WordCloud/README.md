##WordCloud
Word clouds (also known as text clouds or tag clouds) work in a simple way: the more a specific word appears in a source of textual data (such as a speech, blog post, or database), the bigger and bolder it appears in the word cloud.

First of all the data which was processed in data processing has been read in this part.
Then the wordcloud module has been used to create the wordcloud of texts.

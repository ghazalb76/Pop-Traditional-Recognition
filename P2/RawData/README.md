#Why pop and traditional recognition?
I love music and listen to all types of it. I'm guitarist
so I need to listen to music and analyze them more than anyone.
Music is in every moment of my life and everything about it is nice, interesting 
and important for me and my lessons are not exception.Briefly, recognizing different 
styles of music is my interest and because this project is about recognition between two
types of something, I have chosen the two important styles: Pop and traditional

#Resource:
Data of this project is the lyrics of music so the source of it can be any web sites that provide lyrics.
I have used [shazam](https://www.shazam.com/gb) for all the lyrics.
<br>

#Way of data collection:
As I told before shazam is good for lyrics and I have just copied the lyrics from this web site to
.txt format files
<br>

#Wanna add your data to my project?
It is so easy you just need to make a new .txt file , copy the lyric of your favourite music and put it in 
correct directory or you can use a web crawler for extracting large data from a web site.

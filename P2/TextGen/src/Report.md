###unigram:
In sentences which have been generated by unigram you can see that there are just some words that have been unioned together with no special meaning
and maybe two verbs or two same words come together.
Words in unigram text generation sit next to each other and their relation is not near their relations in train data.
Also you can see that words with higher probability appear more than others.
In unigram text generation the first and end of sentence may be far from first and end of train data.

###biagram:
In sentences which have been generated by biagram words have more meaning than in unigram but still they do not have special meaning but their
probability of coming two verbs or two same words together becomes less than in unigram.
In biagram text generation the words which become at the begining and end of the sentence have been chosen from the first and last words in train data.

###triagram:
In sentences which have been generated by triagram three related words come together in every choice of words so the sentences have more meaning
than unigram and biagram and briefly as we add to n in ngram the sentences will have more meaning and become near our train data but it takes more
time to generate sentences.
